                <p>Stretching from the River Severn to the Irish Sea is a magnificent long-distance footpath known as the Offa's Dyke Path. The 177-mile path offers the walker a fantastic and diverse challenge as it winds through meadows and woods, along rivers and canals, past castles and forts, and over hills and mountains. The route roughly follows the line of the Welsh-English border within the Welsh Marches region, and much of its length follows the course of the ancient and iconic Offa's Dyke earthwork. </p>
                <p>This classic walk also takes in numerous stunning towns towns and villages, many of which provide refreshments and accommodation. The whole walk can usually be accomplished by a reasonably fit walker within two weeks.</p>

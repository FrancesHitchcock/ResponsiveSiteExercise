# Fictional Holiday Company - Scrimba Module 6: Responsive Design 

## About The Exercise

This recommended exercise was undertaken to consolidate responsive design skills learnt during the first part of the Scrimba Responsive Design module. The web page was built from scratch using my own jpeg images, and demonstrates the following responsive functionality:

- Media queries for large and small screen sizes based on a break point of 768px. The site takes a 'mobile-first' approach to facilitate dry code and to ensure the site provides an optimal user experience on small screens.
- Max-widths to prevent uncomfortably long text lines of text on larger screens.
- Percentages and relative units including rems for text and ems for padding and margins.
- Responsive header and navigation using flex-box.
- Larger buttons suitable for smaller touch-screens and adapted for larger screens (using flex-box). 
- Smaller font sizes and decreased white space for smaller screens.
- A fully-responsive image gallery using the flex-basis and flex-grow properties.
- The object-fit and object-position properties to preserve image aspect ratios on resizing.

In addition, the site incorporates accessibility features including semantic html, descriptive image alt text, increased line spacing values and element ordering.

The colour scheme was inspired by a coolors.co palette.
